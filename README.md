# Python Workshops @ ANU (CBE)

This is a drop-in style workshop for those interested in learning a bit more
about the Python programming language. This is one of the languages used in the
online [QuantEcon Lectures Series](https://lectures.quantecon.org/). It is also
used widely for Scientific Computing.

**Note:** Please bring your laptop to the workshop

## Schedule

### Friday 16th June 2017 

**Topic:** Python Installation and Jupyter Notebooks

This workshop will aim to reduce the fixed costs of setting up a Python
environment by leading you through the installation of Anaconda (a scientific
python distribution) on Windows / OS X / or Linux. We will then take a look 
at Jupyter notebooks, what they are, and how to use them. 

**Time:** 2:00pm - 3:00pm 

**Location:** Fred Gruen Seminar Room


### Friday 23rd June 2017

**Topic:** Python Programming Basics - Get Up and Running

The aim of this workshop
is to expose you to the Python language so you can get up and running
and start exploring the language. 
It will run through basic python syntax (i.e. the role of
white space in Python scripts etc.), we will write your first Python
program, and explore the available ecosystem of packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib). 
We will then move onto discussing Object Oriented Programming 
and the role of objects and basic Class structure.
